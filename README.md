# TypeScript D&D Game

This project is a TypeScript D&D (Dungeons & Dragons) Game aimed at improving your skills in the TypeScript language. The game allows you to create classes and assign different aspects to them and to the duelists, who can then engage in battles. The primary focus of the project is the utilization of TypeScript.

## Overview

The TypeScript D&D Game is a text-based role-playing game where you can create custom classes and define various aspects for those classes and duelists. The game simulates battles between the created duelists based on their assigned attributes and abilities. The project serves as an excellent opportunity to enhance your TypeScript knowledge while having fun with game development.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools were utilized in the development of this project:

- TypeScript: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It provides type checking and enhanced JavaScript features, resulting in improved code quality and maintainability.
- Game Development: The project involves game development concepts and methodologies to create the D&D-inspired gameplay mechanics and logic.

## Functionality

The TypeScript D&D Game offers the following functionality:

- Class Creation: It allows the creation of custom classes, each with its unique aspects and attributes.
- Duelist Creation: The game enables the creation of duelists by assigning them specific classes and configuring their attributes.
- Battle Simulation: The duelists can engage in battles based on their assigned attributes and abilities, resulting in simulated battles between different classes.
